## Description

⟹ Our Idea: Extending Sitecore Content Hub CLI with Plugins 

- Module Purpose:
	Export Assets from Content Hub using Content Hub CLI
	Create Email Template in Content Hub using Content Hub CLI

- What Problem does it solve?
At present, we have found two opportunities with Sitecore Content Hub.
1. If you want to move Assets from One instance of Content Hub to another, there is no straight forward way available. Either you do this manually, or PowerShell, or any kind of Middleware. But, the thing is, you need to write a piece of code and host it somewhere. 
2. If you want to create an Email Template in Sitecore Content Hub, again, there is no Create button to create it directly. You need to write a console application to create an Email template, while later you can change the Subject and Body, although Name, Label and Variables remain the same.

- How does this module solve it?
We have created a Custom Plugin, and developed Two Comamnds as a part of the Sitecore Hackathon 2025, to take care of both the above - Exporting Assets from Content Hub and Creating an Email Template in Content Hub - using Sitecore Content Hub CLI.
